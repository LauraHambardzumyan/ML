        /*
         The landscape of machine learning (ML) is vast and constantly evolving, encompassing a wide range of techniques, algorithms, tools, and applications. Here's an overview of some key aspects of the ML landscape:

1. **Types of Machine Learning**:
    - **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.
    - **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
    - **Semi-supervised Learning**: A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm learns from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
    - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment to achieve a goal, where the algorithm learns to make sequential decisions to maximize cumulative reward.

2. **Algorithms**:
    - **Linear Regression**

        /*
         Machine learning can broadly be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type addresses different learning scenarios and is associated with distinct algorithms and approaches.

1. **Supervised Learning**:
   Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each example consists of input data and its corresponding output or target variable. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing the model to make predictions or decisions on unseen data.

   - **Example**: Given a dataset of housing prices with features like size, location, and number of bedrooms, the task is to predict the price of a house based on these features.
   - **Algorithms**: Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks.

   Supervised learning tasks can be further divided into regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, and classification tasks, where the target variable is categorical.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   Unsupervised learning involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset, where the algorithm learns patterns or structures within the data without explicit guidance. The objective is to uncover hidden relationships or groupings in the data.

   - **Example**: Clustering similar documents together based on their content without prior labels.
   - **Algorithms**: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), autoencoders.

   Unsupervised learning tasks include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions.

   - **Example**: Training an AI agent to play video games by rewarding it for achieving high scores and penalizing it for making mistakes.
   - **Algorithms**: Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQN), policy gradients, actor-critic methods.

   Reinforcement learning tasks often involve learning optimal decision-making policies to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Applications include robotics, game playing, autonomous driving, and resource management.

Each type of machine learning has its own set of challenges and applications. Supervised learning is widely used in tasks such as classification, regression, and recommendation systems. Unsupervised learning is valuable for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. Reinforcement learning excels in scenarios where decision-making involves sequential actions and delayed rewards. Understanding these different types of machine learning is crucial for selecting appropriate algorithms and techniques to tackle diverse real-world problems.
